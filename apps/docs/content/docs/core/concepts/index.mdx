The Daydreams framework enables autonomous agent behavior through core concepts
that work together. This guide helps you navigate these concepts effectively.

## Learning Path

**New to agent frameworks?** Start here:

1. [Building Blocks](/docs/core/concepts/building-blocks) - The four main
   components
2. [Agent Lifecycle](/docs/core/concepts/agent-lifecycle) - How agents process
   information

**Ready to build?** Dive into each component:

- [Contexts](/docs/core/concepts/contexts) - Manage state and memory
- [Actions](/docs/core/concepts/actions) - Define capabilities
- [Inputs](/docs/core/concepts/inputs) - Handle external events
- [Outputs](/docs/core/concepts/outputs) - Send responses
- [Building Block Operations](/docs/core/concepts/building-block-operations) - Common patterns

**System Architecture:**

- [Services](/docs/core/concepts/services) - Infrastructure management
- [Extensions](/docs/core/concepts/extensions) - Feature packages
- [Extensions vs Services](/docs/core/concepts/extensions-vs-services) - Decision guide

**Advanced topics:**

- [Context Composition](/docs/core/concepts/composing-contexts) - Modular functionality
- [Prompting](/docs/core/concepts/prompting) - LLM interaction structure
- [MCP Integration](/docs/core/concepts/mcp) - External service connections
