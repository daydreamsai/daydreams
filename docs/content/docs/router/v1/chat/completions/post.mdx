          accounts.


          - **Supported Assets**: USDC

          - **Networks**: Base

          - **Protocol**: x402 standard for AI micropayments

          - **Benefits**: No account funding, transparent pricing, crypto-native
          experience


          ## Cost Calculation

          Costs are calculated based on:

          - **Input Tokens**: Text you send to the model

          - **Output Tokens**: Text generated by the model

          - **Model Pricing**: Different models have different rates


          ## Error Handling

          The API handles various error scenarios:

          - **402 Payment Required**: Insufficient balance or invalid x402
          payment

          - **429 Rate Limited**: Too many requests
