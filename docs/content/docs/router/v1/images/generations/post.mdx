          # Image Generation API


          Generate images from text prompts using AI models like OpenAI
          GPT-Image 1 and Google Imagen.


          ## Supported Models

          - **openai/gpt-image-1**: OpenAI's latest image model with editing,
          inpainting, and outpainting support via the Images API

          - **imagen-4.0-generate-001**: Google Imagen 4.0 for high-quality
          image generation


          ## Request Parameters

          - **prompt**: Text description of the image to generate

          - **n**: Number of images to generate (1-8)

          - **size**: Image dimensions (e.g., "1024x1024", "1920x1080")

          - **quality**: Model-specific quality tier (e.g., "low/medium/high"
          for GPT-Image 1, "standard/hd" for Imagen)

          - **response_format**: "url" or "b64_json"


          ## Pricing

          Images are charged per generated output image. GPT-Image 1 supports
          granular pricing per quality tier and resolution (e.g., low 1024x1024
          at $0.011), while Google Imagen continues to offer standard vs. HD
          (2x) pricing.

          - Platform fee: 20% added to the computed base cost
